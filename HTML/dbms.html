        Write SQL queries to
        a)	Retrieve details of all books in the library – id, title, name of publisher, authors, number of copies in each branch.
        b)	Get the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 3 books, but from Jan 2017 to Jun 2017.
        c)	Partition the BOOK table based on year of publication. Demonstrate its working with a simple query.
        d)	Create a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently available in the library.
        e)	Delete a book in the BOOK table. Update the contents of other tables to reflect this data manipulation operation.

<h1>VIVA QUESTIONS</h1>
<p>1.What is SQL?<br>
    Structured Query Language<br><br>
    2.	What is database?<br>
    A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning, representing some aspect of real world and which is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.
    <br><br>3.	What is DBMS?
    <br>It is a collection of programs that enables user to create and maintain a database. In other words it is general-purpose software that provides the users with the processes of defining, constructing and manipulating the database for various applications.
    <br><br>4.	What is a Database system?
    <br>The database and DBMS software together is called as Database system.
    <br><br>5.	Advantages of DBMS?
    <br>Redundancy is controlled.
    <br>Unauthorized access is restricted.
    <br>Providing multiple user interfaces.
    <br>Enforcing integrity constraints.
    <br>Providing backup and recovery.
    <br><br>6.	Disadvantage in File Processing System?
    <br>Data redundancy & inconsistency.
    <br>Difficult in accessing data.
    <br>Data isolation.
    <br>Data integrity.
    <br>Concurrent access is not possible.
    <br>Security Problems.
    <br><br>7.	Describe the three levels of data abstraction?
    <br>There are three levels of abstraction:
    <br>Physical level: The lowest level of abstraction describes how data are stored.
    <br>Logical level: The next higher level of abstraction, describes what data are stored in database and what relationship among those data.
    <br>View level:The highest level of abstraction describes only part of entire database.
    <br><br>8.	Define the "integrity rules"
    <br>There are two Integrity rules.
    <br>Entity  Integrity:States  that ―Primary  key cannot have  NULL value‖
    <br>Referential  Integrity:States  that  ―Foreign  Key can be  either  a  NULL  value  or should be Primary Key value of other relation.
    <br><br>9.	What is extension and intension?
    <br>Extension - It is the number of tuples present in a table at any instance. This is time dependent.
    <br>Intension -It is a constant value that gives the name, structure of table and the constraints laid on it.
    <br><br>10.	What is Data Independence?
    <br>Data independence means that ―the application is independent of the storage structure and access strategy of data‖. In other words, The ability to modify the schema definition in one level should not affect the schema definition in the next higher level.
    <br>Two types of Data Independence:
    <br>Physical Data Independence: Modification in physical level should not affect the logical level.
    <br>Logical Data Independence: Modification in logical level should affect the view level.</p>
